## Emails

From Mike Humphrey on 09/15/20

Hey all,

As most of you know, we've had some meetings to discuss some potential changes to the scope & design of the Albums feature. After those conversations, this is where we're at currently:

Goals & Rewards are delayed - to make sure that the goals/rewards are as impactful as possible, we're going to hold off on releasing them until early '21 in a v.2 release; this gives the Design/Product/Content teams more time to come up with impactful rewards for players

Video unlock removed from Goals & Rewards system - instead of unlocking the video as part of the Goals & Rewards system, we'll be tying it to completion of X challenges in each album (global config-defined), silently triggered when the player completes that # of rooms

Albums will include past designs - there was a miscommunication about whether past designs would be sorted into non-All Designs albums; with this change, we can take all designs done prior to release of the Albums feature, and sort them into the appropriate albums, including past Series entries; this is going to require additional backend work, but with the reduced scope in other areas, Will and Aaron think this should be doable within the current release schedule

Possible UI change to Designs tab - we're removing the rewards from all non-Challenge Albums (so Series, Homes and My Albums will not have goals or grant rewards); Hailey & Barlow are exploring the possibility of some sort of UI indicator to show/explain which album categories give rewards and which don't - front-end engineering team have indicated that this is a relatively trivial addition if we want to move forward with it

I think that covers what we discussed today. If I missed any items, please feel free to chime in and reply!

Per Jason

There are two configs that control the tabs you see on the profile screen.
12:54
CLIENT_PROFILE_MY_USER_TABS and CLIENT_PROFILE_FOREIGN_USER_TABS

12:54
Each of them is a list of numbers where each number corresponds to the different types of tabs you could see.
12:55
The description in CMS on those configs shows the numbers and their corresponding tab.
12:55
Youâ€™ll want to change those lists to include the album tab number if you want the album feature to be visible.
12:56
Additionally, ALBUM_ENABLE_FAVORITE_BUTTON is a simple toggle that determines whether or not to allow the favorites button to appear on the design info screen.

ALBUM_ENABLE_FAVORITE_BUTTON

User Profile:
Albums ON:  CLIENT_PROFILE_MY_USER_TABS = [4,2,3]
Albums OFF: CLIENT_PROFILE_MY_USER_TABS = [0,2,3]
Foreign Profile:
Albums ON: CLIENT_PROFILE_FOREIGN_USER_TABS = [4]
Albums OFF: CLIENT_PROFILE_FOREIGN_USER_TABS = [0,1]
